# VNRbot

_An angry bot that makes your images even more angry_

---
### How VNRbot works:
1. You give it an image by tweeting '@vnrbot #vnrthis'
2. It sends it back with a red tint and a light radial motion blur. (yeah i know)

<br>

### Currently: 

It may encounter problems due to the read-only file system it's hosted on.
Tweets nothing but replying **'bonsoir'** when you @ it. It can post an image if you use the right words.

* Node.JS
* Twit package
* Hosted on Heroku
