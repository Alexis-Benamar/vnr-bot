# vnrbot

> _An angry bot that makes angrier images_

## How it works:

1. You give it an image by tweeting `@vnrbot #vnrthis`
2. It (hopefuly) sends it back with a red tint, a light radial blur and some other effects. (Right now that's a dead meme but I'll definitly finish this by 2020)

## Currently:

Tweets nothing but replying **'henlo'** when you @ it. It can post an image if you use the right words.
There's also a hidden feature but you don't need that one

## TODO

* FINISH IT ðŸ˜¡
* Reorganize file structure. Maybe split tweets & logic
* Image processing â†’ separate Go script ?
* Rethink image pipeline

## Stack

* Node.JS
* Twit package
* Hosted on Heroku
