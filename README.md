# VNRbot

_An angry bot that makes your images even more angry_

---
### How VNRbot works:
1. You give it an image by tweeting '@vnrbot #angrierpls'
2. It sends it back with a red tint and a light horizontal motion blur.  

<br>

### Currently: 

Tweets nothing but replying **'bonsoir'** when you @ it. It can post an image if you use the right words.
